Extended example apps for RubyMotion

## CustomBadge

This is a RubyMotion port of Jonathan Rasmusson's Swift Arcade 
CustomBadge example. It illustrates the ability to create custom
UI bits and pieces. Flip the rootViewController in app_delegate.rb
to 1 or 2, depending on which part you want to look at.

## FailedBanksCD

This example is an extension of the RubyMotion Sample app called [Locations](https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/Locations). 
However, it is also based on Ray Wenderlich's [Core Data Tutorial - Getting Started](http://www.raywenderlich.com/934/core-data-on-ios-5-tutorial-getting-started).

You see, I wanted to check out CoreData for use in a project, but realized I didn't know enough.  And the Locations app, while
a good start, doesn't include tricky stuff like relationships between entities, which I will require.

While I did get it all working, with much simpler code than I found in [other](https://github.com/caramdache/games) places, 
I do not consider this a "good" implementation of CoreData relationships.  It is, however, simple and easy to understand,
and understanding was my goal, so I can move on to the more complex issues, like loading a huge dataset.

## WeatherTV

This example illustrates the creation of an AppleTV app, displaying weather for several pre-defined locations. This app is very loosely based on [Appcoda's tvOS introduction](https://www.appcoda.com/tvos-introduction/)

Uses [Climacons font](https://github.com/christiannaths/Climacons-Font).

## FlowRubyGemsActivity

This is an example of using Flow, based on https://motionpdx.github.io/blog/2016/07/14/cross-platform-mobile-development-with-flow/.  But I tweaked some of the startup things, and I pulled data from the Ruby Gems Activity API endpoint.

## Marslink

This is a RubyMotion port of the [IGListKit Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/147162/iglistkit-tutorial-better-uicollectionviews) from Ray Wenderlich's site.  See my [blog](https://www.wndx.com/archives/tag/iglistkit/) for all the gory details.
