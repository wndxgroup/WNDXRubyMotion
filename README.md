Extended example apps for RubyMotion

## FailedBanksCD

This example is an extension of the RubyMotion Sample app called [Locations](https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/Locations). 
However, it is also based on Ray Wenderlich's [Core Data Tutorial - Getting Started](http://www.raywenderlich.com/934/core-data-on-ios-5-tutorial-getting-started).

You see, I wanted to check out CoreData for use in a project, but realized I didn't know enough.  And the Locations app, while
a good start, doesn't include tricky stuff like relationships between entities, which I will require.

While I did get it all working, with much simpler code than I found in [other](https://github.com/caramdache/games) places, 
I do not consider this a "good" implementation of CoreData relationships.  It is, however, simple and easy to understand,
and understanding was my goal, so I can move on to the more complex issues, like laoding a huge dataset.
